# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a compact UI scaling system that reduces the size of all visual elements (containers, padding, margins, spacing) by approximately 50% while preserving text sizes and readability. The goal is to create a more space-efficient interface that maintains usability and accessibility standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a more compact interface that uses less screen space, so that I can see more content at once without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the compact scaling is applied THEN all container elements SHALL be reduced by 50% in size
2. WHEN the compact scaling is applied THEN all padding values SHALL be reduced by 50%
3. WHEN the compact scaling is applied THEN all margin values SHALL be reduced by 50%
4. WHEN the compact scaling is applied THEN text font sizes SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN the compact scaling is applied THEN line heights SHALL remain proportional to maintain readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the compact interface to maintain visual hierarchy and spacing relationships, so that the design remains coherent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are scaled down THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN spacing is reduced THEN relative proportions between elements SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN the compact mode is active THEN border radii SHALL be scaled proportionally
4. WHEN the compact mode is active THEN box shadows SHALL be scaled proportionally
5. WHEN the compact mode is active THEN icon sizes SHALL be reduced by 50%

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the compact interface to work across all device sizes, so that I can benefit from space efficiency on both mobile and desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compact mode is applied THEN it SHALL work on mobile devices (320px+)
2. WHEN compact mode is applied THEN it SHALL work on tablet devices (768px+)
3. WHEN compact mode is applied THEN it SHALL work on desktop devices (1200px+)
4. WHEN compact mode is applied THEN responsive breakpoints SHALL be adjusted accordingly
5. WHEN compact mode is applied THEN touch targets SHALL remain at least 44px for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the compact interface to maintain accessibility standards, so that the interface remains usable for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compact mode is active THEN minimum touch target sizes SHALL be preserved (44px minimum)
2. WHEN compact mode is active THEN color contrast ratios SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN compact mode is active THEN focus indicators SHALL remain visible and appropriately sized
4. WHEN compact mode is active THEN screen reader compatibility SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN compact mode is active THEN keyboard navigation SHALL function normally

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the philosophy section to be collapsible with a minimize/maximize menu bar, so that I can save screen space while still having access to the content when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices (768px and below) THEN the philosophy section SHALL have a collapsible menu bar
2. WHEN the philosophy section is collapsed THEN only the menu bar with title SHALL be visible
3. WHEN the user taps the menu bar THEN the philosophy content SHALL expand smoothly
4. WHEN the philosophy content is expanded THEN the user SHALL be able to collapse it by tapping the menu bar again
5. WHEN the philosophy section is collapsed THEN a minimize/maximize icon SHALL indicate the current state
6. WHEN the philosophy section state changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and accessible
7. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the collapse/expand functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic approach to apply compact scaling, so that the implementation is maintainable and consistent across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing compact scaling THEN a CSS custom property system SHALL be used for scalable values
2. WHEN implementing compact scaling THEN existing CSS SHALL be modified to use scalable units
3. WHEN implementing compact scaling THEN the solution SHALL be applied to all major layout components
4. WHEN implementing compact scaling THEN the solution SHALL be applied to navigation elements
5. WHEN implementing compact scaling THEN the solution SHALL be applied to content sections
