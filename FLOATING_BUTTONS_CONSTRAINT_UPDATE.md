# Floating Buttons Constraint Update

## Overview
Updated the floating buttons system to constrain buttons to stay within the hero section (banner area) only, preventing them from floating beyond the banner container.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Updates (`floating-buttons.js`)

#### Modified `calculatePositions()` method:
- Now gets the hero section bounds instead of just the floating container bounds
- Positions the floating container to overlay the hero section exactly
- Uses hero section dimensions for positioning calculations
- Reduced radius and spiral increment to keep buttons within banner area
- Added proper padding to ensure buttons don't touch banner edges

#### Added `positionContainerOverHero()` method:
- Positions the floating container to perfectly overlay the hero section
- Updates container position, size, and styling dynamically
- Maintains proper z-index and pointer-events

#### Added `calculateFallbackPositions()` method:
- Provides fallback positioning if hero section is not found
- Uses original positioning logic as backup

#### Enhanced event listeners:
- Added scroll event listener to maintain hero section alignment
- Container repositions when user scrolls to keep buttons in banner area

### 2. CSS Updates

#### Updated `styles.css`:
- Removed padding from `.floating-container` (now handled by JavaScript)
- Added comment explaining JavaScript positioning

#### Updated `index.html` critical CSS:
- Synchronized critical CSS with main stylesheet changes
- Removed padding from floating container

#### Updated `styles.min.css` and `critical.css`:
- Applied same changes to minified and critical CSS files

### 3. Generated New Minified Version
- Regenerated `floating-buttons.min.js` with updated functionality
- Maintains all original features while adding banner constraint

## Key Features

### Banner Constraint
- Buttons are now constrained to stay within the hero section boundaries
- Container dynamically resizes and repositions to match hero section
- Buttons cannot move beyond the banner area

### Responsive Behavior
- Maintains responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Adjusts button positioning based on mobile/desktop breakpoints
- Proper padding ensures buttons don't touch banner edges

### Scroll Handling
- Container follows hero section position during scroll
- Buttons remain properly positioned relative to banner
- Smooth repositioning with debounced scroll events

### Fallback Support
- Graceful fallback if hero section is not found
- Console warning for debugging purposes
- Original positioning logic as backup

## Testing
Created `test-floating-buttons.html` for testing the constraint functionality:
- Visual hero section with blue border
- Multiple floating buttons (service and navigation types)
- Content below hero to verify constraint behavior
- Test scrolling and resizing behavior

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers
- Maintains accessibility features
- Preserves keyboard navigation
- Supports touch interactions

## Performance Considerations
- Debounced resize and scroll events (250ms and 100ms respectively)
- Efficient DOM queries with caching
- Minimal layout recalculations
- Smooth animations maintained

## Usage
The floating buttons will now automatically:
1. Position themselves within the hero section on page load
2. Reposition when window is resized
3. Follow the hero section during scroll
4. Stay constrained to the banner area at all times

No additional configuration required - the constraint is applied automatically when the FloatingButtonManager is initialized.
