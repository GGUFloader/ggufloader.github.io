## üîç Detailed Diagnostics

### Issue 1: EmailJS Library Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: "EmailJS library not loaded"
- Form shows: "EmailJS service is not available"

**Causes:**
- No internet connection
- CDN is blocked (firewall, ad blocker)
- Script tag is incorrect

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Internet Connection**
   ```
   Open any website to verify internet works
   ```

2. **Check if CDN is blocked**
   - Disable ad blockers temporarily
   - Check firewall settings
   - Try a different browser

3. **Verify Script Tag**
   Open `hire-me.html` and check line 12:
   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.emailjs.com/sdk/2.6.4/email.min.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Test CDN Directly**
   Open this URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://cdn.emailjs.com/sdk/2.6.4/email.min.js
   ```
   You should see JavaScript code, not an error.

### Issue 2: Wrong Configuration

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: "401 Unauthorized" or "404 Not Found"
- Email doesn't send

**Causes:**
- Incorrect Public Key
- Incorrect Service ID
- Incorrect Template ID
- Typos or extra spaces

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Your Credentials**
   
   Open `hire-me.html` and find this section (around line 19):
   ```javascript
   const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
       publicKey: "Aif7atVmhmC4vCzO2",      // Check this
       serviceId: "service_7evq2pa",         // Check this
       templateId: "template_u8bup9s"        // Check this
   };
   ```
