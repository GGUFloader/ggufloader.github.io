# GGUF Loader Website Deployment Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying and monitoring the GGUF Loader website.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

For immediate deployment to production:

```bash
# Run complete deployment process
npm run deploy

# Or step by step:
npm run deploy:test    # Pre-deployment testing
git push origin main   # Trigger GitHub Actions deployment
npm run post-deploy:monitor  # Post-deployment monitoring
```

## üìã Deployment Process Overview

The deployment process consists of several phases:

1. **Pre-deployment Testing** - Comprehensive test suite validation
2. **GitHub Pages Deployment** - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
3. **Deployment Propagation** - Wait for changes to propagate
4. **Post-deployment Monitoring** - Verify deployment success and performance
5. **Report Generation** - Create deployment reports and logs

## üéØ Deployment Environments

### Production (GitHub Pages)
- **URL**: https://ggufloader.github.io
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Continuous via scheduled jobs

### Development
- **Local Server**: `npm run serve` (http://localhost:8080)
- **Testing**: All test suites available locally
- **Preview**: Jekyll build preview before deployment

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Automated Monitoring
- **Daily**: Site availability, performance metrics, error monitoring
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive testing, SEO validation, security checks
- **Monthly**: Full audits, dependency updates, content review
- **Quarterly**: Strategic reviews, major updates, compliance checks

### Performance Thresholds
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5 seconds
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100 milliseconds
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1
- **Lighthouse Performance Score**: > 90
- **Lighthouse SEO Score**: > 95
- **Lighthouse Accessibility Score**: = 100

### Alert Conditions
- Site downtime or inaccessibility
- Performance metrics exceeding thresholds
- JavaScript errors or console warnings
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Accessibility compliance failures

## üîí Security Considerations

### Pre-deployment Security
```bash
# Security audit
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Dependency vulnerability check
npm audit fix

# Security headers validation
npm run test:cache-headers
```

### Ongoing Security
- Automated daily security scans
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly comprehensive security audits
- Quarterly security policy reviews

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Pre-deployment Optimization
- Image compression and modern format conversion
- CSS and JavaScript minification
- Critical CSS inlining
- Lazy loading implementation

### Monitoring Performance
```bash
# Performance monitoring
npm run monitor:performance

# Lighthouse audit
npm run test:lighthouse

# Core Web Vitals check
npm run performance:check
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check deployment status
npm run dashboard

# Review deployment logs
ls deployment-logs/

# Run pre-deployment tests
npm run deploy:test
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check performance metrics
npm run monitor:performance

# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run test:lighthouse

# Review performance reports
ls monitoring-reports/
```

#### Site Accessibility Issues
```bash
# Check site availability
curl -f https://ggufloader.github.io

# Run health check
npm run health-check

# Monitor deployment
npm run monitor:deployment
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Rollback Process
1. Identify the issue and assess impact
2. Locate the last known good commit
3. Create emergency rollback branch
4. Revert to stable version
5. Deploy rollback via GitHub Actions
6. Monitor rollback deployment
7. Document incident and plan fix

#### Emergency Contacts
- **Technical Issues**: Check GitHub Issues
- **Performance Problems**: Review monitoring dashboard
- **Security Concerns**: Run security audit immediately
